## Hi there 👋

I'm Rodrigo, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University focusing on optimal and learning-based control for complex dynamical systems.

- 🔭 Building a reinforcement-learning-based control framework with Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety filters for internal combustion engines  
  → [RL-CBF Controller Project](https://github.com/rhadlich/RayProject.git)

- 💡 Interests: optimal control, reinforcement learning, hybrid energy systems, and safety-critical AI

- 🛠 Tools: Python, PyTorch, Ray/RLlib, MATLAB, control & optimization
